# Introduction

1. SQL : structured query language;
2. sql is standard language for the manuplating the data in the RDBMS (Relationship database manangement system)
3. RDBMS first developed in 1970

    RDBMS Benifits and Limitations !?
    benifits of the RDBMS :  
    1. Structured Data: allows the data to be stored in structured way that is in rows and columns.
    2. ACID Property: Atomicty, consistency , Isolation and Durability. this helps safe data manipulation.
    3. Normalizaion : Removes the data redundancy 
    4. Scalability : allowing to more storage
    5. Data Integrity : RDBMS provides mechanism like primary key, secondry key, uniqueness
    6. Security: allows various safety mechnism like authentication,encreption and etc

    Limitations fo the RDBMS:
    1. complexity: setting up of the RDBMS for large scale application is costly
    2. cost: can be costly
    3. fixed schema: schemas are regid 
    4. handling of the unstructured data: cannot able to handle the unstructured data.
    5. Horizontal scaling: horizontal scalling can  be challenging
